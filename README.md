## PCA

Principal component analysis (PCA) looks at the variance between features in a dataset to construct a linear transformation which results in an ordered set of vectors that describe the variance within the data.
By keeping a subset of these vectors (those that explain the most variance) we can reduce the size of our dataset while minimizing the information loss by reducing the vectors.
